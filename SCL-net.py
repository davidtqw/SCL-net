We will open source the SCL-net code once our paper is accepted.
Thank you for your interest.
We propose a lightweight person re-identification baseline, in which the basic modules of the model are composed of a new SC-unit.
Our SCL-net has about 2.3M parameters and without any pre-training, and it can achieve 95.2%/85.9% on Rank-1 and mAP, which can rival the most state-of-the-art large-scale models.
